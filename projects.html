          <p> The purpose of this project was to familiarize ourselves with the Raspberry Pi 
          and sensors. My team and I built a Home Laser Defense system with an ultrasonic sensor, laser, and LED 
          lights. The system works by triggering a yellow LED when an object is between 20-30 inches. However,
          when an object is less than 20 inches away a red LED is triggered and so it the laser.</p>

          <p> My team and I created a two-player pinball game. We utilized four push buttons, four relays,
          two seven-segment display, decorative christmas lights, five DC motors, and LDR sensors to determine when a goal was 
          made. Whenever a goal was made, the seven-segment displays were updated to display the current score. However, once 
          a player reaches nine points the game ends and the christmas lights begin the flash.</p>

          <p>Based on real-life natural disasters, our project draws inspiration from the destruction of —homes, businesses, 
          and lives—that is left behind after avalanches. Our project simulates an avalanche, which is caused by an earthquake.
          The hardware that we utilized for this project includes: transistors, two relays, LED lights, LDR sensors, and two servo motors. 
          In addition, we created a sound visualizer by using a combination of capacitors, NPN transistors, and LED lights.</p>

          <p>For our project, we will be built an autonomous ping-pong defense system (APPDS). The key elements of this project 
          includes: the insides of a printer, PVC barrel, switches,  a PiCam, which is a camera, and a compressor. The system works
          by identifying approaching people, shifting the barrel accordingly, and shooting a ping-pong ball using compressed air.</p>
